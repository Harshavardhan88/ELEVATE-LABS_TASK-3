# ELEVATE-LABS_TASK-3
**Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
**Objective**
Understand and implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

Tools used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Project Steps**
1.Imported and preprocessed the Housing dataset.

2.Split data into training and testing sets.

3.Built models:

  ~Simple Linear Regression (Area vs Price)

  ~Multiple Linear Regression (Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms vs Price)

4.Evaluated models using:

  ~MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

  ~MSE (Mean Squared Error)

  ~RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

5.Visualized:

  ~Regression Line

  ~Residual Plot

6.Checked Multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
